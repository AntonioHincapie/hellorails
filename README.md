# Hello Rails App
Let's put this into practice by creating our very own Rails 'Hello World!' project!

## Built With

- Visual Studio Code and GitHub.
- Ruby on Rails.
- Linters for RoR.
- Gitflow.

## Getting Started

As you know by now, we have a clear path from the browser to the routes file to the Controller action, which can pull data from the database through the Model and create an instance variable that is then sent to the View to be displayed to the user.

## Instalation
- Clone repository.

- Bundle install.

- rails server
